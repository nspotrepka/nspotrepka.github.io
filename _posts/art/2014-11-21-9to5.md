Caffeine 9 to 5 is a commentary on the often cyclical and confusing nature of
work. Beginning from the bottom going clockwise, we begin the day with notions
of openness, order, play, and ease. The mind appears to be free and perfect. As
the day draws to a close, the scene is violently interrupted by a mishmash of
darkness, angularity, noise, and strange creatures. Following the disturbance,
the subject awakens to a contorted, rectangular version of himself. Then he sips
on a beverage and embarks again on his daily adventure.

My hope with this drawing is to highlight the lighter side of work and to
encourage the viewer to imagine new possibilities outside the normal confines of
assumed reality.
