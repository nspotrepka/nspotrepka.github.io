# Project Description

Here is a simple C++ audio DSP library that I am writing. The library is part of
a larger audio software project that I am building for the purpose of producing
electronic music in a live setting. The main principles of the library are
simplicity, modularity, and live music synthesis. Feedback and contributions are
welcome!
